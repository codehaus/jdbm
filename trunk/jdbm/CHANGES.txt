CHANGE LOG
==========

For version 0.09:
    * This is a major upgrade in terms of functionality.  We now have
      a GDBM-like API (actually, very much like Hashtable) and added 
      explicit commit/rollback functionality.
    * Repackaging com.cdegroot.recman.* to jdbm.recman.*
    * Added jdbm.* package -- GDBM-like access
    * Added jdbm.hash.* package -- HTree implementation and corresponding
      test cases.
    * Changes in jdbm.recman.RecordManager to support commit() and rollback().
      This change affected many classes in jdbm.recman.*, notably
      TransactionManager.   Added new test case for rollback().
    * Test framework now integrated in the build.
    * Updated most of the code to reflect the new BSD license.

For version 0.081:
    * Important bug fix.  TransactionManager had a bug which could potentially
      corrupt the database file when the database was not closed explicitly.
      See bug #103848 on SourceForge.

For version 0.08:
    * Cleanups. Cleaning up recman/FileHeader seems to have affected
      performance, but not bad enough for now (we can always optimize
      it again).
    * Added support for "root" rowids, which are special rowids that
      are accessed by an index and stored in the file header. Can be
      used for bootstrapping access to other structures.

For version 0.07:
    * Updated license to GNU Library General Public License.
    * More verbosity in doc comments on recman/RecordManager.
