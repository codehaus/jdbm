<H2>Background</H2>
Somewhere in '93, I set out to write an OO database in C++. Shortly after
I had finished the basics, I decided that C++ sucked, and therefore stopped
working on the project. In December'99, a mail from someone asking for a
simple page manager prompted me to dig up this old package and convert
it to Java. At the moment, it is fairly simple but it is already useful
as a local storage for software that wants to stash away objects for 
example in order to comply with Jini transaction semantics.

<H2>Dependencies</H2>
I use <A href="ftp://ftp.armaties.com/ftp/TestingFramework/JUnit/">JUnit</A>
for unit tests, so you want to have that (the runtime is included in
the downloads, but no documentation etcetera). My make files assume GNU make.
