(Importance: - low; * normal, + high)

* Allow for explicit transaction scoping so multiple operations can be
  combined.
* Clean byte and structural integrity checker.
* Higher level layers: write and read Objects (+), support for collections,
  references, etcetera (-).
* Some indexing mechanism. 
- ODMG compliance, including OQL :-)
- I think especially recman/PhysicalRowIdManager can do with some
  refactoring.
- Combine free blocks when deleting. Before tackling this, I'd like
  some figures of real-world fragmentation (todo: instrumentation).
