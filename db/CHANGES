For version 0.08:
    * Cleanups. Cleaning up recman/FileHeader seems to have affected
      performance, but not bad enough for now (we can always optimize
      it again).
    * Added support for "root" rowids, which are special rowids that
      are accessed by an index and stored in the file header. Can be
      used for bootstrapping access to other structures.

For version 0.07:
    * Updated license to GNU Library General Public License.
    * More verbosity in doc comments on recman/RecordManager.
